# Environment variables for the Simple Svelte Todo MVP

# IMPORTANT: This file should typically be added to .gitignore to prevent
# committing sensitive information like API keys to version control.

# Variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the client-side code
# accessible via `import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME`.
# Other variables are only available during the build process or server-side.

# Example of a variable exposed to the client (e.g., for an API endpoint if needed later)
# VITE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001/api

# Example of a client-side feature flag
# VITE_ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE=false

# --- Application Specific Variables ---

# Note: This specific MVP uses browser localStorage for persistence and has no
# backend or external API dependencies defined in its core scope.
# Therefore, no specific environment variables are strictly required for its
# current functionality. The examples above demonstrate the format for future use.

# Example of a server-side only variable (e.g., if a backend were added)
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
# API_SECRET="your_secret_key_here"
